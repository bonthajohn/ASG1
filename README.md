## Design Process
 
The colors chosen for the website are appropriate for a wedding services company and will have a positive effect on the overall design.

The background color is a soft pastel greenish-blue that creates a calm and serene atmosphere, commonly associated with weddings. Pastel colors are often used in wedding designs because they give off an elegant and sophisticated vibe.

The white background color of the navigation bar gives a clean and timeless appearance, which is often associated with purity and simplicity, fitting well with the wedding theme.

The navigation links on the website are a deep blue-green color which complements the background and adds a touch of richness. This color choice is subtle and sophisticated, contributing to a formal and stylish look.

The navigation link hover color is a turquoise shade that adds interactivity and liveliness to the navigation. Turquoise is known for its calming properties and visually pleasing appearance, making it a suitable choice for highlighting interactive elements.

The use of a turquoise background for the main heading draws attention to it and creates a focal point on the page. This color choice also helps to maintain a cohesive and visually pleasing design.

The button's background color is a bright green shade that contrasts with the overall color scheme, making it noticeable and encouraging users to interact with it. Green is commonly associated with growth and harmony, which makes it a favorable color choice.

The button hover color is a turquoise shade that matches the overall color scheme. It is used to give users a visual indication that the button is interactive.

The dropdown content has a light gray background color (#f9f9f9) to make it easy to read and have a neat look. This color choice helps it blend well with other colors and prevents the screen from appearing too busy.

In general, this design matches the theme of wedding services and creates a visually appealing experience for users. The choice of soft and muted colors adds to the elegant and sophisticated look, which is commonly desired for websites related to weddings. With this design, I hope to reach out to an audience of adults/working adults that want to get married whenever they feel like it.
